/**
 * Craft a Automated Game Prototype Simulator
 *
 * This project aims to create a simulator that can generate and play automated game prototypes based on a set of rules and configurations.
 *
 * Features:
 *  - Generate game prototypes with random or predefined configurations
 *  - Simulate gameplay with automated decision-making
 *  - Analyze and visualize game performance and metrics
 *  - Support for multiple game genres and mechanics
 *
 * Classes:
 *  - GamePrototype: Represents a single game prototype with its configuration and game state
 *  - GameSimulator: Responsible for simulating gameplay and making decisions based on the game prototype's configuration
 *  - GameAnalyzer: Analyzes and visualizes game performance and metrics
 *
 * Configuration:
 *  - gameSettings: An object containing game-specific settings, such as game mode, difficulty, and player count
 *  - simulationSettings: An object containing simulation-specific settings, such as simulation speed and iteration count
 *
 * Dependencies:
 *  - None
